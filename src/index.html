        Emergency alerts are a new way for the emergency services to warn people when lives are in danger.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        In an emergency, mobile phones and tablets in the affected area will receive an alert. The alert will tell people what they need to do to stay safe.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        This service is being developed by the UK government and mobile phone networks.

        Emergency alerts are sent using mobile phone masts. You get them based on where you are, not who you are.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The emergency services will not need your phone number to send you an alert.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Most people will get alerts automatically. You will not need to sign up for them.
