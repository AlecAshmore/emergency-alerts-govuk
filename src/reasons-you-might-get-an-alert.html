        If thereâ€™s a danger to life in the local area, you might get an emergency alert.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You may also receive occasional test alerts, to make sure the system is working.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts can be used to warn the public about:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>severe flooding</li>
        <li>fires</li>
        <li>explosions</li>
        <li>terrorist incidents</li>
        <li>public health emergencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
       Only the emergency services and authorised government agencies can send alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        For most people, the chance of receiving an emergency alert is low.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        How often you receive an alert depends on where you live or work. For example, if you spend a lot of time in an area with a high risk of severe flooding, you may get more than one alert a year.
