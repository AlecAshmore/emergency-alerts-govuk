        How to opt out of emergency alerts
      </h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can opt out of some emergency alerts, but not the most important ones.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You cannot opt out by subject, only by how serious the emergency is. If you opt out because you do not want flood warnings, for example, you’ll also miss alerts for fires and terrorism.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Because of this, you should keep emergency alerts switched on for your own safety.
