        How Emergency Alerts works
      </h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency Alerts works like a radio broadcast.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        During an emergency, mobile phone masts in the surrounding area will broadcast an alert. Every compatible mobile phone or tablet in range of a mast will receive the alert.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The emergency services will not need your phone number to send you an alert.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll get alerts based on your current location - not where you live or work.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency Alerts are free and you will not need to sign up for them or download an app.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        No one will collect or share data about you, your phone or your location when you receive an alert.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your phone can still receive alerts if you’re on a call.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You will not get alerts while your phone or tablet is turned off or in aeroplane mode.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/alerts/opt-out">opt out of Emergency Alerts</a>, but we recommend that you keep them switched on for your own safety.

        Make sure your device has all the latest software updates.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency Alerts work on:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>iPhones and iPads running iOS 14.5 or later</li>
        <li>Android phones and tablets running Android 11 or later</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you have an earlier version of Android, you may still be able to receive alerts. To check, search your settings for ‘Emergency Alerts’.

        Mobile phone networks
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency Alerts work on all UK 4G and 5G phone networks.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Phones and tablets connected to a 2G or 3G network will not receive Emergency Alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency Alerts do not cause, and are not affected by, busy phone networks.
