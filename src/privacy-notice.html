        Emergency Alerts

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts are used to warn people when there’s a life-threatening event nearby.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        They can be sent by:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the emergency services</li>
        <li>government departments, agencies and public bodies that deal with emergencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts are broadcast from mobile phone masts to every compatible phone and tablet within range.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The sender does not need to know your mobile phone number or any other personal data to send you an alert.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        No one will collect or share data about you, your phone or your location when you receive an emergency alert.
      </p>

        The UK government is still testing Emergency Alerts. If you are in a test area and receive a test alert, you may want to complete the feedback survey.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The survey asks questions about your experience of Emergency Alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Question 7 asks you to enter your email address. This question is optional.
      </p>

        The legal basis for sending emergency alerts is the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) 2003.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The PECR says that some public authorities can ask MNOs to send an emergency alert if an emergency:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>has happened</li>
        <li>is happening</li>

        An ‘emergency’ is defined in section 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.
