        The emergency alert system is tested to make sure it works well. Testing also lets you see what an alert looks like on your device.

        All <a class="govuk-link" href="/alerts/how-alerts-work#compatible-devices">compatible devices</a> will receive national tests. The time and date of tests will be available in advance.

        Your device will make a loud siren-like sound for about 10 seconds. You do not need to take action.

        You can turn off your device or switch it to airplane mode during the test period if you do not want to receive the alert.

        Service test alerts

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The government and mobile network operators occasionally carry out emergency alerts service tests across the UK.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        These are different from national tests. You’ll only get service test alerts if you have an older Android phone or tablet with operator test alerts turned on.

        Your device may make a loud siren-like sound for about 10 seconds. You do not need to take action.

        To opt out of service alerts, turn off ‘test alerts’ in your settings. If you still get alerts, contact your device manufacturer for help.

        For most people, the chance of receiving a service test alert will be low.
