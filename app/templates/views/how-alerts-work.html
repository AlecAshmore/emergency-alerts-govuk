        How emergency alerts work
      </h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        In an emergency, mobile phone masts in the surrounding area will broadcast an alert. Every compatible mobile phone or tablet in range of a mast will receive the alert.
      </p>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        Emergency alerts work on all 4G and 5G phone networks in the UK.
      </div>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your mobile phone or tablet does not have to be connected to mobile data or wifi to get alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts are free. You do not need to sign up for them or download an app.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Reasons you will not get an alert
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You will not receive alerts if your device is:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          turned off or in airplane mode
        </li>
        <li>
          connected to a 2G or 3G network
        </li>
        <li>
          wifi only
        </li>
        <li>
          not compatible

        Compatible mobile phones and other devices
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Make sure your device has all the latest software updates.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts work on:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          iPhones running iOS 14.5 or later

        <li>
          Android phones and tablets running Android 11 or later
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you have an earlier version of Android, you may still be able to receive alerts. To check, search your device settings for ‘emergency alerts’.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        If you want to see an alert again
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To see an alert again, go to <a class="govuk-link" href="/alerts/current-alerts">current emergency alerts</a> or
        <a class="govuk-link" href="/alerts/past-alerts">past emergency alerts</a>.
      </p>

        You can also search for emergency alerts on your mobile phone or tablet.

        If you get reminders about an alert
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Android phones and tablets may get more than one reminder about the same emergency alert. You can turn these reminders off through the ‘emergency alerts’ settings on your phone.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Opting out of emergency alerts
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can opt out of emergency alerts, but you should keep them switched on for your own safety.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To opt out:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Search your settings for ‘emergency alerts’.</li>
          <li>Turn off ‘severe alerts’ and ‘extreme alerts’.</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you still get alerts, contact your device manufacturer for help.

        Your personal data
